# Pocket Homelab


A personal Linux homelab built on an Android phone using Termux.

This project is focused on learning backend, Linux, and systems fundamentals by running real services under strict constraints (no Docker, no systemd, limited resources).

## Goals
- Understand how backend services actually run
- Learn process management and observability
- Practice Git and documentation as part of development
- Build everything step-by-step

## Current State
- Git initialised and connected to GitHub
- Environment documented
- More services coming next

## Why Termux?
Using Termux removes abstractions and forces understanding of:
- process
- ports
- failures
- supervision

This is intentional.
